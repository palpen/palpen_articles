title: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng
---

I recently began Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning on Coursera. For each week in the course, I will write down some of the key and new ideas covered in that week. My hope is that these posts will serve as a reference for when I need to draw on these techniques for my own research in the future.

The Github repository for my solution to the exercises (written in Matlab) can be found [here](https://github.com/palpen/ml/tree/master/coursera_ml)
