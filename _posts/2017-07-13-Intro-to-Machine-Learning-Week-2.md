title: Intro to Machine Learning Week 2
---

Week 2 covers materials on multivariate linear regressions and a tutorial on Octave and Matlab. Having done some estimation and simulations of macroeconomic models during my PhD, I was already familiar with some of Matlab's syntax and so was able to skip this part. Multivariate linear regression is also a familiar topic. The new ideas here expand on the same idea from week 1, which is using the gradient descent algorithm to estimate linear equations. Some of the new and useful ideas covered are as follows:

1. Like in week 1, the multivariate linear regression is estimated using the gradient descent. This is done using the updating rule
