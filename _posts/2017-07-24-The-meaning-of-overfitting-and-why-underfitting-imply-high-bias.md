title: The meaning of overfitting and why underfitting imply high bias

Here's an excerpt to a very clear definition of what it means for your statistical model to suffer from overfitting [(original post)](http://andrewgelman.com/2017/07/15/what-is-overfitting-exactly/):

I like the last point in the post because it ties into why models that are too simple are described to exhibit high bias (and, hence, suffers from underfitting).
