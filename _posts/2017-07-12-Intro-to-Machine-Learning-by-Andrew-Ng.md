I recently began Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning on Coursera. For each week in the course, I will summarize what was covered in the lectures and the exercises. My goal is to have a collection of articles containing the main ideas behind machine learning so that they may serve as a reference for when I need to use these techniques in the future.
