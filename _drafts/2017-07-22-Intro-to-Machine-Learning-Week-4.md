Weeks 4 and 5 of the course covers Neural Networks, a learning algorithm modeled after the brain.

<!--excerpt-->

Neural networks is useful for cases where the classification problem requires a very complicated non-linear decision boundary. In these cases, the problem lies in modeling the hypothesis using higher order polynomials for very many features. For example, to predict house prices your data may include features containing information on size in sq. feet, number of bedrooms, number of floors, age, etc. In addition to these individual features, you may need to construct interaction terms of these features. This results in the functional form of your hypothesis increasingly more complicated. The estimation of such hypothesis is apparently
