# Principal component analysis


<!--excerpt-->

Principal component analysis (PCA) is an algorithm for reducing the dimension of ones data. In this blog post, I will focus on discussing how this algorithm is connected to ideas in linear algebra. In particular, how eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used in PCA. The goal is to dig deeper into the mathematical foundations of this tool to gain a better theoretical understanding for how it is applied.

Math:
* orthogonal linear transformation
* single value decomposition
* Variance covariance matrix

Resources:
* Andrew Ng ML youtube lecture 14 and 15
